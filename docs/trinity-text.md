# Trinity PS3 text extraction

The English and Japanese PS3 releases can be inventoried without modifying
their retail trees. Keep generated retail-derived output under the ignored
`build/` tree:

```sh
./zill trinity-extract --game-dir Trinity/TrinityEN \
  --output build/trinity/english
./zill trinity-extract --game-dir Trinity/TrinityJP \
  --output build/trinity/japanese
```

The command decodes the eight localized LINKDATA members and extracts PARAM.SFO
strings and all SFM trophy XML files. A disc `.dkey` decrypts the ISO layer, not
the SELF executable layer. To include executable strings, use RPCS3's dedicated
binary-decryption operation on a temporary `EBOOT.BIN` copy, then pass the
result without placing it in the retail tree:

```sh
rpcs3 --headless --decrypt /tmp/trinity-eboot/EBOOT.BIN
./zill trinity-extract --game-dir Trinity/TrinityEN \
  --eboot-elf /tmp/trinity-eboot/EBOOT.elf \
  --output build/trinity/english
```

Use the same temporary-copy operation for the Japanese `EBOOT.BIN`, then pass
that release's ELF to its extraction command. The extractor authenticates the
release-specific executable rather than accepting one region's ELF for the
other.

Each LINKDATA asset and optional decrypted ELF is preserved losslessly and
accompanied by a JSON inventory of printable string candidates with byte
offsets. Candidate inventories are navigation aids; the lossless binary files
are authoritative. `manifest.json` records source and output hashes, storage
metadata, and excluded non-text inputs. Output is published atomically and is
never overwritten.

With both LINKDATA extractions present, the search command finds those standard
build directories automatically. Search English text with ripgrep and display
the structurally equivalent Japanese record:

```sh
./zill trinity-search 'Areus! A fine match'
```

Search Japanese instead and display its English counterpart with:

```sh
./zill trinity-search --language japanese 'アレウス！'
```

`trinity-search` requires `rg` on `PATH` and accepts ripgrep regular-expression
syntax plus `--ignore-case` and `--max-count`. It pairs localized strings by
LINKDATA member and nested record path; it never assumes that English and
Japanese byte offsets or heuristic candidate ordinals are equal. An ambiguous
1,200-row table in member 275 is deliberately omitted because its rows were
reordered and its metadata is not a unique identity. Executable strings remain
lossless searchable inventories, but are not claimed as cross-release
equivalents because their binaries do not provide the same record identity.
